# STM32-BMP280-Drivers-I2C
- Developing a driver for my Grove BOSCH BMP280 on the I2C interface using C in STM32cubeIDE-
- Will ADD more in main when driver gets working, for now, all iterations of driver will be under the "In-Development" Branch. Unlikely to be a working iteration. 
- Working Initialization Function
